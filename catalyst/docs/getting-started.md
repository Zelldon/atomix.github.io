## Overview

Catalyst provides a custom I/O and serialization framework that it uses for all disk and network I/O. The I/O framework is designed to provide an abstract API for reading and writing bytes on disk, in memory, and over a network in a way that is easily interchangeable and reduces garbage collection and unnecessary memory copies.
