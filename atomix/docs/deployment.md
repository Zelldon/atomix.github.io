## Deployment

Deploying Atomix, as with any distributed system, involves weighing the tradeoffs between latency and fault-tolerance. While Atomix enhances fault tolerance by replicating data across its cluster, actual system deployments may benefit from considering the location of Atomix instances with respect to physical points of failure on the underlying infrastructure.

In a private datacenter deployment, Atomix embedded components, particularly members of the [cluster seed group][cluster-seed], may be deployed on separate racks to minimize the liklihood of a single hardware failure bringing down the cluster. In a cloud deployment, an Atomix cluster may be deployed across AZs in order to minimize void being effected by a zone outage. The tradeoff for locating cluster members behind separate points of failure is increased latency when it comes to processing write operations.
